    label:
      required: true
      type: string

    io-channels:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: |
        Channels available with this divider configuration.

    output-ohms:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        Resistance of the lower leg of the voltage divider

    full-ohms:
      type: int
      required: false
      description: |
        Resistance of the full path through the voltage divider.

        If absent or zero the driver assumes that the upper leg is a
        resistance-based sensor.

    power-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: false
      description: |
        Control power to the voltage divider inputs.

        If present the corresponding GPIO must be set to an active level
        to enable the divider input.
