  The Arduino Uno Rev3 is a board who's popularity lead to countless shields being developed for it. By
  natural extension, once there were many shields designed for it, many other *boards* began to be developed
  that were compatible to leverage the extensive available shields. Today, many dev kits come with Uno
  headers to make it easy to work with them.

  Note: ZMK doesn't support boards with AVR 8-bit processors, such as the ATmega32U4, because Zephyrâ„¢ only
  supports 32-bit and 64-bit platforms. As a result, boards like the original Arduino Uno Rev3 itself are
  *not* supported by ZMK.

design_guideline: |
  The GPIO pin references for the Uno format are a bit odd. The `&arduino_header` label is used, but the numbering
  starts at the `A0` pin and increments as you go counter clockwise around the board. That means the `D6` pin
  can be referenced by `&arduino_header 12` in your overlay files.
