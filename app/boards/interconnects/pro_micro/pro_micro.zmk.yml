  The SparkFun Pro Micro grew popular as a low cost ATmega32U4 board with sufficient GPIO and peripherals
  to work for many keyboard needs. Since the original Pro Micro, many pin compatible boards have appeared,
  with various changes or improvements, such as the Elite-C w/ USB-C, nice!nano with nRF52840 wireless.

  Note: ZMK doesn't support boards with AVR 8-bit processors, such as the ATmega32U4, because Zephyrâ„¢ only
  supports 32-bit and 64-bit platforms. As a result, controllers like the SparkFun Pro Micro and the Elite-C
  are *not* supported by ZMK.

design_guideline: |
  ZMK uses the blue color coded "Arduino" pin names to generate devicetree node references. For example, to refer to the pin labeled `0` in the diagram, use `&pro_micro 0` in the devicetree files.
