# Keymap Upgrader

Some behaviors, key codes, and other features have been renamed to be more consistent with each other. This tool will upgrade most deprecated features to their replacements.

Paste the contents of a `.keymap` file below. Then, hover your mouse over the upgraded keymap and click the `Copy` button in the upper-right corner to copy it to your clipboard.

Lines that have been modified in the upgraded keymap will be highlighted.

:::warning

The upgrader does not handle key codes inside a `#define` or a behavior creation macro such as `ZMK_MACRO()`, so you will need to update those manually using
[this list of deprecated codes and replacements](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/blob/main/docs/src/keymap-upgrade/keycodes.ts).
